          <li>The root of my ambition is community; if I have the keys, I'm unlocking all the doors.</li>
          <li>A decade in food service taught me there is no job more virtuous than another and that affording a life beyond survival is a privilege.</li>
          <li>I'm one of very few indigenous, immigrant, queer engineers in this industry; this is not an invitation to tokenize me but a fact that visibilizes my journey in tech.</li>
          <li>Computer programming is the means by which I can access shelter, food, healthcare, and a future while protecting my body and nurturing my mind.</li>
          <li>I am proud to a have been a waitress, barista, babysitter, and dog-walker before becoming an engineer. And, to be quite honest, if feeding people, caring for children, or hanging out with pups was valued and compensated as highly as building features on a website, I'd be doing that full time instead :)</li>

        <ul>
          <lh><h3>My ever-evolving skills</h3></lh>
