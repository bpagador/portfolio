        Hi, great to see you! Welcome to my Portfolio --v 1.0.
        <p>I hope we meet someday to talk about how important this year has been and how momentous that--despite radical unrest, uncertainty, and constant, forthcoming change--you landed here, to meet me. Thanks for stopping by, everything you need to know about me (for now) is here. Enjoy your stay and remember: this is just the beginning.</p>
