        <p>Hi, great to see you! Welcome to my Portfolio --v 1.0.</p>
        <p>
                    I hope we meet someday to talk about how important this year has been and how
                    momentous that--despite radical unrest, uncertainty, and constant, forthcoming
                    change--you landed here, to meet me. Thanks for stopping by, everything you need
                    to know about me (for now) is here. Enjoy your stay and remember: this is just
                    the beginning.
